//! Defines the functions for spawning async tasks.
//! # Transaction example
//! We can spawn a transaction using the following code:
//! ```
//! use async_runtime::spawning::spawn_transaction;
//! use futures_lite::future;
//!
//! async fn transaction() {
//!    // Do some async work here
//! }
//!
//! let task_handle = spawn_transaction(transaction());
//! let outcome = future::block_on(task_handle);
//! ```
//! # Commit example
//! We can spawn a commit using the following code:
//! ```
//! use async_runtime::spawning::send_to_commit_pipeline;
//! use futures_lite::future;
//!
//! async fn commit() {
//!   // Do some async work here
//! }
//!
//! let task_handle = send_to_commit_pipeline(commit());
//! let outcome = future::block_on(task_handle);
//! ```
//! # Background tasks
//! We can spawn a task and never block a thread to await for the result with the following:
//! ```
//! use async_runtime::spawning::spawn_transaction;
//! use futures_lite::future;
//!
//! async fn transaction() {
//!    // Do some async work here
//! }
//!
//! spawn_transaction(transaction()).detach();
//! ```
//! We can also spawn a commit task within the transaction task so we never have to await for the results and block threads for them. With our own custom poll
//! functions we can have a lot of control on how tasks are processed, when we drop them, or when we await for them.
